# readMe

A simple Chrome extension for creating a reading list based on bookmarks.

## Usage
Once you have installed the extension, create a bookmark folder called `readMe`.

Whenever you click the `Read Next` button of the extension, it will show you the first URL in that folder and remove it from the folder. While reading, you can add notes in the popup of the extension. 

Clicking the `Show List` button will take you to an overview of all the links you have read already and the notes you made on them.
